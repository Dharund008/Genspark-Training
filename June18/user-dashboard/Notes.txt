injecting the http client:

1)constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
2)private http = inject(HttpClient);


both are same ... 
1) -> The HttpClient is injected into the service through the constructor, allowing it to be used throughout the class.
This is the traditional way of injecting dependencies in Angular,

2)Newer Approach with inject(): Instead of injecting HttpClient via the constructor, inject(HttpClient) directly retrieves the instance.
inject() is a newer Angular feature that allows dependencies to be injected without using a constructor.
This approach is useful when you need dependency injection outside of a class context (e.g., inside functions or standalone components).
mainly best for services, working outsdie a class...
