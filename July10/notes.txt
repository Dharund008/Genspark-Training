1)go to azure portal : search azure devops > azure devops organization

2)create an organization and create new project

3) Now if needed , assign the user to the project ... [have the azure access level as basic - so can assign in tasks / if stakeholder or... can't assign 
in task by administrator.]

4)Then create epic - work item tab > new work item - 'epic'  : enter title and description.
also have the state as 'new'...

make sure to have the organization access with azure ... because only with that u can add user stories under epics.

5) Now to create user stories : your-epic > related work > add link > new item :
                                                                                link type - child
                                                                                work item type - user story
                                                                                title - 

now u can view it under work item tab and backlogs tab tooo ...also u can check with links under each epic

6)after creating user story under epics, create tasks for each user story .... can be any no of tasks under it

backlog > hover near user story > [starting corner] '+' symbol - new task : title,description 

also can view it from workitems , backlog and also from the links section under user story ... 


7)then now create an kanban board for the project : boards > new board : select the project and the board name

ToDo - Doing - Done : segregate it 

now add your user stories under the board : drag and drop the user story under the board [todo / doing / done]



8) assign sprint to each user story : 

* administrator creates different sprints : sprint1 <ranges from - to -> , sprint2 <ranges from - to -> etc...
* then assign the sprint to each user story
* under each user story > iteration field > u can see the sprint name and click it > and select it to sprint .... 
* now under sprint tab > can view different user stories under each sprint ..... 

you can also mark it as new/active/closed... which dynamically updates under items..
