    <!-- interpolation : display a variable dynamically inside an HTML template.-->
     Hello {{name}}

     <!-- {{ name }} is replaced by the value of name inside first.component.ts -->
       <!-- Whenever name changes, the UI updates dynamically. -->

    <!-- flow of interpolation:
    1) name is declared in first.component.ts under export class FirstComponent { }
    2) name is passed to first.component.html
    3) {{ name }} is replaced by the value of name in first.component.html -->

    <!-- property binding : sets the value of an HTML element dynamically based on a component property -->
    <h4>Property Binding</h4>
    <input type="text" #hname [value]="uname" placeholder="Enter your name" />


    <!-- flow of property binding:
    1) name is declared in first.component.ts under export class FirstComponent { }
    2) name is passed to first.component.html
    3) [name] is replaced by the value of name in first.component.html
    The input field will show "Ramu", but changes in the input wonâ€™t reflect in name. -->

<hr>

    <!-- Two way binding : sets the value of an HTML element dynamically based on a component property and also updates the component property -->

    <input type="text"  [(ngModel)]="name"  placeholder="Enter your name" />

    <!-- flow of two way binding:
     Step 1: Import FormsModule in app.module.ts
     Step 2: Define name inside first.component.ts
     Step 3: Add Two-Way Binding in first.component.html

    1) name is declared in first.component.ts under export class FirstComponent { }
    2) name is passed to first.component.html
    3) [[ngModel]] is replaced by the value of name in first.component.html
    4) changes in the input field - goes changes -  in name in first.component.ts
    5) changes in name in first.component.ts - goes changes -  in first.component.html(for every attributes using "name" prop)
    changes in input field, instantly updates the "name" in ts file dynamically! -->

    <button (click)="onButtonClick(hname.value)">Click Me</button> <!--only for property binding... -->

        <h5>Event Binding</h5>

    <!-- event binding : listens to user actions and triggers a function when an event (like a click) occurs. -->

    <i [class]="clasName" (click)="toggleLike()" > </i>

    <!-- when user click the icon/an thing/obj subjected to the "classname", calls the toggleLike() function in first.component.ts
    the class property used to change the subject's(classname) style dynamically. -->

    <!-- flow of event binding:
    1) declare the function in first.component.ts
    also declare the class property 
    Step 1: Define toggleLike() inside first.component.ts
    
    2) pass the function to first.component.html
    Step 2: Use Event Binding in first.component.html -->

    <!-- User clicks on the heart icon (which has (click)="toggleLike()" attached).
    toggleLike() runs:
    If like was false, it becomes true, changing the heart to filled.
    If like was true, it becomes false, switching back to empty.
    Angular detects the change and updates the icon instantly. -->
