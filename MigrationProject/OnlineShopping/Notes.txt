Quick Tip: Testing the Service

To test it's working:

Temporarily change Task.Delay(...) to 10 seconds or 30 seconds.
Create a product with a SellEndDate = DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(5).
Watch it get marked as IsSaleEnded = true in DB after ~10 seconds.
Then switch it back to 10 minutes for real use:

await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10), stoppingToken);
